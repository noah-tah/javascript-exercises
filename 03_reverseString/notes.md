so to reverse a string we would break it down into all of its letters

then we would take the last letter off of the string and store it somehwere into a variable

continue doing this for each character in the string


ok what if i solved it like this: find the length of the string, then iterate over the length, storing the next character into memory and then appending it to the reversed string
